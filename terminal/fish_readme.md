### Install Schwifty Theme For Fish Shell on MacOS
1. Install [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/) if you haven't yet (I recommend [starship](https://starship.rs/) as well)
2. On your Mac navigate to your current User (i.e. Users/Bob/)
3. Show hidden folders ( run ` command + shift + .`)
4. Go to `.config/fish/`
5. Take the `fish_variables` [file](./fish_variables) from this repo and replace your current `fish_variables` file
6. Restart your shell
