## Schwifty

This is schwifty a theme based on Atom One Dark. Get Schwifty! This Theme is still in its infancy and will still be growing and changing. It should work well for most langauges as I refered to Atom One Dark while creating this version.

## Setup Matching Brackets

Use the VS code Extenstion 'Bracket Pair Colorizer 2', for matching your brackets. 
Then paste this in your `settings.json` to have the colors match the Schwifty Theme:

`"bracket-pair-colorizer-2.colors": ["#f9a571","#56cbf9", "#9ba2ff"]`

Then save, and restart VS code to get matching brackets like below:

### What Font am I using ?
 I am currenlty using [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) patched w/ [Fira Code's](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) Ligatures. I patched these two together with [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer). 
 
 [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/operatormono) is another great font (though expensive) that you can expand with [Fira Code's](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) ligatures using the tool above or I used [operator-mono-lig](https://github.com/kiliman/operator-mono-lig). 
 
 Another decent font but not as good as the other two in my opinion is [Cartograph](https://connary.com/cartograph.html I found a site that sells single variants of it [here](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/connary-fagen/cartograph-cf/).
 
 _*I am not affilated with any of the above fonts or companies._ 
 
 A free version would be to use a patcher to path a italic font with Fira Code. There is a few github projects that combine Fire Code with [FlottFlott](https://github.com/kosimst/FiraFlott) and [Pacifco](https://github.com/kosimst/Firicico).
