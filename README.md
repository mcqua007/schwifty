## Shwifty

This is Shwifty a theme based on Atom One DarK. Get Shwifty! This Theme is still in its infancy and will still be growing and changing. It should work well on most langauges as I refered to Atom One Dark while creating this first version.

## Setup Matching Brackets

Use the VS code Extenstion 'Bracket Pair Colorizer 2', for matching your brackets. 
Then paste this in your `settings.json` to have the colors match the Shwifty Theme:

`"bracket-pair-colorizer-2.colors": ["#f9a571","#56cbf9", "#9ba2ff"]`

Then save, and restart VS code to get matching brackets like below:
