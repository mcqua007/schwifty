## Setup Matching Brackets

Use the VS code Extenstion 'Bracket Pair Colorizer 2', for matching your brackets. 
Then paste this in your `settings.json` to have the colors match the Schwifty Theme:

`"bracket-pair-colorizer-2.colors": ["#f9a571","#56cbf9", "#9ba2ff"]`

Then save, and restart VS code to get matching brackets like below:
