## Schwifty

This is schwifty a theme based on Atom One Dark. Get Schwifty! This Theme is still in its infancy and will still be growing and changing. It should work well for most langauges as I refered to Atom One Dark while creating this version.

# Installation

1. Open **Extensions** sidebar panel in VS Code. `View â†’ Extensions`
2. Search for `Schwifty` - find the one by **decrypteddesign** - there is one other so make sure you have the right one!
3. Click **Install** to install it.
4. Click **Reload** to reload the your editor
5. Code > Preferences > Color Theme > **Schwifty**
6. Optional: Use the recommended settings below for best experience

## Setup Matching Brackets

Use the VS code Extenstion 'Bracket Pair Colorizer 2', for matching your brackets. 
Then paste this in your `settings.json` to have the colors match the Schwifty Theme:

`"bracket-pair-colorizer-2.colors": ["#f9a571","#56cbf9", "#9ba2ff"]`

For Purple variant: `"bracket-pair-colorizer-2.colors": [ "#F86AA3", "#56cbf9", "#9ba2ff" ],`

Then save, and restart VS code to get matching brackets like below:

## What Font am I using ?

 
 I am currenlty using [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) patched w/ [Fira Code's](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) Ligatures. I patched these two together with [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer). *Note that in the images above the font is only Dank Mono with its orginal ligatures. Below I have listed some alternatives to the above font and some other cool coding fonts.

 - **Paid Alternatives** (_*I am not affilated with any of the above fonts or companies._ )
    1. [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/operatormono) is another great font (though expensive) that you can expand with [Fira Code's](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) ligatures using the tool above or I used [operator-mono-lig](https://github.com/kiliman/operator-mono-lig). 
 
    2. [Cartograph](https://connary.com/cartograph.html) is another decent font. I found a site that sells single variants of it [here](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/connary-fagen/cartograph-cf/).
 
      
 
 - **Free Alternatives**
   1. [Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) has a italics variant. 
   2. [Ubunut Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono) has a italics variant.
   3. [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) - has italics-script variant & has it's own ligatures.
   4. [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) has no italics version. Below Fira Code is mixed with italics-script fonts
        -  Fira Code with [Pacifco](https://github.com/kosimst/Firicico). 
        -  Fire Code with [FlottFlott](https://github.com/kosimst/FiraFlott)  

 - **Combined w/ Fira Code Ligatures**: I decided to bake Victor Mono, Plex Mono, and Ubuntu Mono with Fira Code Ligatures for all of you.
      1. [Plex Mono Liga](https://github.com/mcqua007/schwifty/tree/master/coding-fonts/Plex-Mono-Liga(FIra%20Code%20Ligatures))
      2. [Ubuntu Mono Liga](https://github.com/mcqua007/schwifty/tree/master/coding-fonts/Ubuntu-Mono-Liga(Fira%20Code%20Ligatures))
      3. [Victor Mono Liga](https://github.com/mcqua007/schwifty/tree/master/coding-fonts/Victor-Mono-Liga(Fira%20Code%20Ligatures))
